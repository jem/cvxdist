Need to have ordered pairs when connecting controllers and systems. Systems
might expose labelled pins that need to be connected as labels. Or, they might
be numbered. How do we do this? Also need to think about sizes. Important thing
is just to match up the controller pins and system pins accurately. More
difficult and more important in a heterogeneous program.

Systems are responsible for marshalling variables internally, and carry up to a
lot of intelligence about how to solve and manipulate problems. There should be
no worries about putting even very specific stuff into systems - that's what
they're for.
